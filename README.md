# Cypress TestRail Integration


This integration helps you to automatically send test results to TestRail.

Simply add your TestRail credentials in Cypress, decide which test results should be sent to TestRail and you're done!

This is a `TestRail-driven` workflow, so your QA team will always be in charge of the TestRail documentation and Cypress will only work as a testing client and does **not modify** anything in your test cases anymore.

Define new test cases in TestRail, and add automation to it, when you are ready.



### 1. Installation
